  <h1>5 Best Foods to Eat when Studying</h1>
  <br>
 
      
  <p>You may be able to help your test scores by increasing the amount of nutritious foods he or she consumes. This emphasizes the importance of good nutrition for students taking important exams. Your student would be much more concentrated on the task at hand if they are focused, well-nourished, and fulfilled. </p><br>
  <p class="title">1. Dark fruits and veggies for antioxidants</p>
  
  
 

  <ul>
    <li>Berries, especially Blueberries</li>
    <li>Red, Pinto and Black Beans</li>
    <li>Artichokes</li>
    <li>Prunes</li>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Pecans</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="title">2. Fish for Omega-3s</p><br>
  <p>Omega-3s are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which will help your student remain focused during his or her exam. Omega-3s, according to WebMD, are an excellent way to retain focus, brain power, and general alertness. Oily cold-water fish is the best source. While wild Alaskan salmon is the top contender, Omega-3s can also be found in trout, sardines, mackerel, and herring.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="title">3. Complex carbohydrates</p><br>
  <p>Sugar is used as a source of energy in the brain. Unfortunately, the simple sugars in sodas and candy deplete your student's nutrition way too easily to provide consistent energy. This is why complex carbohydrates are so crucial. Our brains need twice as much energy as the rest of our bodies' cells, according to The Franklin Institute. Complex carbohydrates — minimally processed natural fruits, vegetables, and grains — are the best source of this fuel.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whole Grains</li>
    <li>Fresh Fruits & Vegetables</li>
    <li>Beans & Other Legumes</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="title">4. Quality protein</p><br>
  <p>Protein is also essential for long-term energy. To reduce anxiety, WebMD suggests consuming a protein-rich breakfast — something that can come in handy on test day.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lean Meats</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Soy Foods</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="title">5. Water</p><br>
  <p>The importance of proper hydration to brain function cannot be overstated. Encourage your student to drink plenty of water first thing in the morning and to bring a water bottle to the exam. These are two excellent methods for maintaining hydration and mental concentration. Teach them that if they are feeling tired or hungry, they should drink a glass of water.</p>
