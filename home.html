                    <p>Munchies delivers tailored recipes for College Students on a budget or with 
                        specific dietary or religious constraints. So many students tend to skip 
                        out on food, are malnourished or resort to unhealthy options which deteriorates 
                        their health. If we provide them with recipes and suggestions to eat healthier 
                        nd encourage them to cook more, their health and well-being is improved, leading 
                        to improved academic performance. Strive to promote inclusivity of all types of 
                        food restrictions/preferences as well as recommendations for foods that address 
                        college studentsâ€™ state of minds.
